# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this Project Repo, we conducted an ETL on the crowdfunding data. The data was filtered, cleaned, sorted, and placed into panda DataFrames, then converted into CSV Files which can be seen in the Resources Folder. 

Table Schemas were then made in SQL and tables were generated, importing the CSV file data into them, images of results are also in the resources folder under the images folder.
